**Work-in-Progress (aka alpha)**

These are the things that we are currently working on:

- lychee.ai.neat (ES/HyperNEAT AI) is being refactored and unstable.
- lychee.js Studio is being extended with Entity/Scene editing features.


## ELI5 - What is lychee.js?

lychee.js is an Application Engine that has the core idea to reuse components
and isomorphic code across all platforms it delivers to. These platforms can
be incremental in its feature support, which means also low-end platforms like
the Arduino variants are supported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The really only thing lychee.js requires to deliver a platform is a working
`setTimeout(callback, timeout)`, `setInterval(callback, delay)` and an
implemented [Stuff](./libraries/crux/source/platform/html/Stuff.js) data type
that can load files. The shipped officially supported platforms are implemented
by the [lychee.js Crux](./libraries/crux) Library.

The lychee.js Engine delivers to different platforms using so-called
[Fertilizer Adapters](./libraries/lychee/source/platform) which allow feature
detection and automated isomorphic builds from and to every single platform it
supports using the [lychee.js Fertilizer](./libraries/fertilizer).

If a new platform wants full Application support, it requires an implementation
of `lychee.Input`, `lychee.Renderer`, `lychee.Stash`, `lychee.Storage` and
`lychee.Viewport`. If it wants full AI support it additionally requires
`lychee.net.Client`, `lychee.net.Remote` and `lychee.net.Server`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Underneath the lychee.js Engine has a strong serialization and deserialization
concept that allows simulations and re-simulations across all platforms. Errors
can be reproduced everywhere, even network traffic and user interactions are put
in event graphs and identified and learned by neural networks in order to figure
out what module (in the flow-based programming sense) had corrupt states or data.

The [lychee.ai](./libraries/lychee/source/ai) and [lychee.policy](./libraries/lychee/source/policy)
Stack allow generic plug/play usage and creation of neural networks that can
translate generically _every property_ into vectorized features that neural
networks can understand. As everything in lychee.js is serializable and uses a
Composite Pattern, things like traffic sharding, automated layouting or animation
learning and debugging are inclusive.

The [lychee.js Breeder](./libraries/breeder) is a tool to create new Boilerplates
and allows the reusage of Projects as Libraries and vice versa. Every lychee.js
Project or Library is fully isomorphic and can be forked, modified, back-merged
or included as a Library; which also allows A/B testing new Composites or Definitions
in-place live in any Environment or Simulation.

The [lychee.js Strainer](./libraries/strainer) is a tool that lints your code
and translates the code into a knowledge graph that allows the identification of
enums, events, methods, properties and states that adaptive neural networks can
use in order to automatically learn and generate code based on existing data.

The [lychee.js Harvester](./libraries/harvester) is a peer-to-peer server that
allows the sharing of knowledge across the internet. Every lychee.js Project on
this planet is part of a giant meshnet that helps every other lychee.js instance
to learn and evolve more quickly; and stores the knowledge graph in a DHT (a custom
Kademlia to allow shrinking similar to how gzip dictionaries work using MURMUR
and BENCODE/BITON/JSON under the hood).

The [lychee.js Ranger](./libraries/ranger) is a tool for maintenance of local
or remote lychee.js Harvester instances, to quickly force-restart its watcher
plugins or manage its profiles and started project- or library-specific servers.

The [lychee.js Studio](./libraries/studio) is the idea of a "Zen Coding" like
autocompletion IDE that searches the local knowledge graph to quickly setup a
Project/Library and its Definitions by leveraging both reinforced evolutionary
and bayesian learning techniques.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oh, and lychee.js can compile, analyze, bugfix and improve itself, too. That's
essentially what the [./bin/configure.sh](./bin/configure.sh) script does when
it builds and distributes the [lychee.js Crux](./libraries/crux) Library and
the [lychee.js Engine](./libraries/lychee) Library.

**Platform / Fertilizer Support**

The target platforms are described as so-called Fertilizers.
Those Fertilizers cross-compile everything automagically
using a serialized `lychee.Environment` that is setup in
each Project's or Library's `lychee.pkg` file.

Explanations of Target Matrix:

- The `Binary` column describes whether there is a native binary built.
- The `Package` column describes whether there is a native package built.
- The CPU architecture columns describe the target architecture, the host architecture is `x86_64` for all external SDKs.

The `iOS` target currently cannot be delivered to via external SDK on a `Linux` development host; however
it is still possible to create a WebView-using App and use the `html` platform as a fertilizer target.
Alternatively, advanced users are encouraged to use the `nidium` runtime on iOS and MacOS.
